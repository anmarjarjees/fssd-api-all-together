// This function is here just for learning
// it was our first function then we renamed it to be sendMailOld() instead of sendMail()
function sendMailOld() {
    // Just for testing
    // alert("Aha, you want to email us!");

    // Remember that here we need to copy the full template of EmailJS send() method
    // No need to worry! you can take the following code from EmailJS docs

    /*
        Notice that the keys for this object are all equal to the parameter names that we've set in our email template back on EmailJS.

        Also remember the number of the templateParams variable properties, ]
        like how many properties I need to use and it depends on how many input fields we have in our HTML form

        In our HTML form we have the following form fields:
        - Input field for name
        - Input field for email
        - Textarea for message

        Since we have 3 inputs/fields, so we need to prepare three properties as placeholders:

        we can create a variable like "templateParams" with the required properties
        OR 
        we can just pass these properties with their values directly inside emailjs send function        
    */

    // Here is one of the ways by placing object and its properties directly inside the emailjs.send() method:
    /*
    emailjs.send('outlook', 'cbc_demo2',
        {
            from_name: 'Anmar with his students',
            from_email: 'Valid and Exist Email Address',
            project_request: 'here is my request to build for me a project'
        }
    )
    */

    /*
    var templateParams = {
        from_name: 'Anmar with his students',
        from_email: 'Valid and Exist Email Address',
        project_request: 'here is my request to build for me a project'
    }
    */

    // Using our own classical script:
    // Or creating a variable that contains the properties as an object and pass this variable to emailjs.send() method:
    var templateParams = {
        // we need to get the value of user name/full name:
        from_name: document.getElementById("fullname").value,
        // we need to get the value of user's email:
        from_email: document.getElementById("emailaddress").value,
        // we need to get the value of user's project request message:
        project_request: document.getElementById("projectsummary").value
    };

    // for testing:
    // templateParams  is just a JS object ==> objectName.property or objectName.method()
    console.log("the form_name property of templateParams object : " + templateParams.from_name);
    console.log("the from_email property of templateParams: " + templateParams.from_email);
    console.log("the project_request property of templateParams: " + templateParams.project_request);

    // remember that we can also add "userID" to send() method but it is optional :-)
    // these lines of code is from EmailJS docs
    // Below we run our promise/code: emailjs.send()...
    emailjs.send('outlook', 'cbc_demo2', templateParams)
        /*
         now we can supply the then() method for our promise.
         And we can provide two functions:
         - the first one will run when the promise is done/met (pass => run our first anonymous function)
         - the second on will runt when the promise is not done (fail) => run our second anonymous function)
        */
        .then(function (response) {
            console.log('SUCCESS!', response.status, response.text); // has more details
            // output: SUCCESS! 200 OK

            // This line of code is from the Code Institute (LMS Learning):
            console.log("SUCCESS", response); // simpler
            // output: the response object with its two properties: status and text

            // Here we can add our own custom message:
            alert(`
            Thank you ${templateParams.from_name} for emailing us,
            We will reply to you on this address ${templateParams.from_email}
             `);

    /*
      Notice every time we click the send message, we will have our page to be reloaded (refreshed).
 
      This will prevent us from:
      - reading the content of the console window as it will be very fast will disappear quickly.
      - sending the email

      There is a simple trick that we have covered before to prevent the page from being reloaded after calling this function

      We just need to:
      1. Ask this function to return false by adding return false at the very end of the function (last line of code)
      2. We have to add the keyword return before our function name inside the value of the event handler attribute of the HTML

    return false; // To block the from from loading a new page

      "from_email":"anmar@justtestingemailjsdemo.ca",
      "project_request":"Just asking for your instructions"}
);
*/

/*
The other better way is to pass our form element object as a parameter for this function
for this function we need to use the argument "this" in the html attribute when we call the function

the parameter "contactForm" is just a JS "LOCAL" variable  to be replaced with the actual form element

the js variable (the function parameter) which is contactForm => <form> .... </form>

    // for testing the contactForm
    // we need to make sure that contactForm has the <form> html element
    console.log(contactForm); // output the entire form element

    /*
    Now be advised that contactFrom is a variable that contains the <from> object 
    
    we need to access the individual properties (fields) of this form object to get their values:
    we can the values of name attribute
    - name => because we put name="name" in our HTML form element
    - emailaddress => because we put name="emailaddress" in our HTML form element
    - projectsummary => because we put name="projectsummary" in our HTML form element

    to summarize, the values of the "name" html attribute are the properties of the form object
