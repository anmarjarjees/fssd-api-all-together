       In our HTML form we have the following form fields:
       - Input field for name
       - Input field for email
       - Textarea for message

       Since we have 3 inputs/fields, so we need to prepare three properties as placeholders:

       we can create a variable like "templateParams" with the required properties
       OR 
       we can just pass these properties with their values directly inside emailjs send function

      Notice every time we click the submit button of our form,

      This will prevent us from:
      - reading the content of the console window as it will be very fast will disappear quickly.
      - sending the email!

      There is a simple trick that we have covered before in our previous lectures 
      to prevent the page from being reloaded after calling this function

      We just need to do the following two steps:
      1. Ask this function to return false by adding return false at the very end of the function (last line of the function code)
      2. We have to add the keyword return before our function name inside the value of the event handler attribute of the HTML     
    */

    // Return false is required so "email.min.js" file can have the time to read the content of the HTML form before being refreshed
    // email.min.js is the minified version of email.js code file that will be run by EmailJS services
    return false; // to prevent the default behaviour of the browser of reloading or refreshing the pages
} // end the old sendMail() function

/*
The other better way is to pass our form element object as a parameter for this function
for this function we need to use the argument "this" in the html attribute when we call the function

the parameter "contactForm" is just a JS "LOCAL" variable  to be replaced with the actual form element

the js variable (the function parameter) which is contactForm => <form> .... </form>

    console.log(contactForm); // output the entire form element

    /*
    Now be advised that contactFrom is a variable that contains the <from> object 
    
    we need to access the individual properties (fields) of this form object to get their values:
    we can the values of name attribute
    - name => because we put name="name" in our HTML form element
    - emailaddress => because we put name="emailaddress" in our HTML form element
    - projectsummary => because we put name="projectsummary" in our HTML form element

    to summarize, the values of the "name" html attribute are the properties of the form object
